# The United States and Strategic Resources, 1861–1992

A static, FRUS-led historical decision-support and orientation platform for
understanding how the United States sought access to critical minerals and
strategic resources. It is designed for Department of State employees, Foreign
Service Officers, historians, policy researchers, and students.

**Live site:**
[therealjameswilson.github.io/critical-minerals-records-stage-v2/records-stage.html](https://therealjameswilson.github.io/critical-minerals-records-stage-v2/records-stage.html)

> **Statutory standard:** FRUS is to be “a thorough, accurate, and reliable
> documentary record.” See [22 U.S.C. § 4351(a)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=%28title%3A22%20section%3A4351%20edition%3Aprelim%29).

The main historical experience is hard-bounded to 1861–1992. Post-1992 material
appears only in a separately labeled Modern Context layer.

## What v2 Provides

- A historical homepage organized by atlas, mineral, country, period, episode,
  agreement, law, archive, stockpile case, and FRUS record.
- Reusable History Stack pages that connect an entity to twelve layers: FRUS,
  timeline, official statistics, agreements, geography, law, stockpiles,
  archives, decision process, outcomes, provenance, and Modern Context.
- A complete metadata-only FRUS Subjects discovery index for 1861–1992:
  16,811 document links across 545 volumes.
- A pilot with 10 minerals, including uranium and rare earth elements; 9
  countries or territories; 8 periods; 15 typed agreements or policy
  instruments; 3 laws; 5 administrations; 32 linked FRUS records; and 30 NARA
  query plans.
- 1,222 unit-defined historical observations extracted from official USGS Data
  Series 140 workbooks without project interpolation.
- 1,476 source-defined trade records covering every selectable year: published
  Census multi-year crude-material averages for 1861-1899 and exact-year USGS
  commodity imports and exports for 1900-1992.
- A Historical Geostrategic Atlas with a 1861–1992 year control, historical
  names, documentary access lines, agreements, stockpile policy, NARA query
  plans, synchronized evidence panels, and an accessible table alternative.
- A visible atlas layer registry that keeps bilateral trade-flow, production,
  supplier-share, infrastructure, alliance, boundary, and risk map views locked
  until compatible official data and citations exist.
- A source-visible NARA discovery layer that can use a secret-bearing serverless
  proxy without exposing the API key to GitHub Pages.

This is a public research demonstrator, not an official Department of State or
U.S. Government product.

## Trust Model

FRUS is the narrative spine, not the entire archive. The interface distinguishes:

- **Reviewed FRUS document:** document-level pilot metadata has been checked.
- **FRUS discovery lead:** only subject-authority and volume or chapter context
  are known; open the document before making a claim.
- **Official statistic:** value, unit, year, publication, workbook location,
  source URL, extraction method, and confidence are retained.
- **Partial coverage:** at least one evidence layer is linked and named gaps remain.
- **Research queue:** the schema or discovery route exists but needs verification.

The project never embeds full FRUS or NARA document text. Missing values are not
invented, estimated, or converted to zero. Historical country names are stored
by period. Formal treaties are distinguished from negotiations, concessions,
purchasing agreements, and domestic policy instruments.

- `assets/vendor/maplibre-gl/`: pinned MapLibre GL JS 5.24.0 runtime and license
- `assets/history-stack.js`: reusable twelve-layer entity rendering
- `assets/history-data.js`: shared loaders, escaping, badges, links, and cards
- `assets/portal.css`: responsive, accessible archival interface
- `assets/frus-subjects-index.js`: full metadata-only FRUS discovery index
- `data/history-stack/`: normalized pilot JSON modules
- `data/atlas/`: generated atlas layer registry, overlays, and orientation geometry
- `schemas/`: JSON schemas for core entity types
- `scripts/build_history_pilot.py`: reproducible editorial pilot builder
- `scripts/build_atlas_data.py`: reproducible atlas overlays and basemap builder
- `scripts/ingest_usgs_ds140.py`: official XLSX extractor
- `scripts/ingest_trade_data.py`: official Census and USGS trade extractor

The original parser, scorer, taxonomy, compact event-cache, Records Studio, and
NARA image-support code remain available for compatible metadata workflows, but
the v2 homepage no longer uses the old post-1992 demonstration cache.

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/build_history_pilot.py
python scripts/ingest_usgs_ds140.py
python scripts/ingest_trade_data.py
python scripts/build_atlas_data.py
python scripts/validate_history_data.py
python -m http.server 8000
open http://localhost:8000/records-stage.html
```

The site must be served over HTTP because browsers do not allow modular JSON
`fetch()` calls from a `file://` page.

To test only with the committed datasets:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

## Rebuild Official USGS Statistics

The extractor downloads nine official Data Series 140 workbooks and writes
human-readable JSON. It selects benchmark years through 1992, preserves USGS
units, and skips missing, withheld, estimated-text, and nonnumeric cells.

```bash
python scripts/ingest_usgs_ds140.py --access-date YYYY-MM-DD
python scripts/validate_history_data.py
```

Use `--cache-dir <path>` to retain downloaded XLSX files outside the repository.

## Rebuild Historical U.S. Trade

The trade extractor writes a source-bounded record for every selected year.
For 1861-1899 it uses published Census multi-year averages for the broad
economic class "crude materials." For 1900-1992 it extracts exact-year imports
and exports from the available USGS Data Series 140 commodity workbooks.

```bash
python scripts/ingest_trade_data.py --access-date YYYY-MM-DD
python scripts/validate_history_data.py
```

The two series are not merged. The Census rows are not mineral-specific, and
the USGS rows are national totals without partner-country attribution. Uranium
remains available as a FRUS-led mineral profile, but the trade tab labels its
annual series unavailable because no compatible uranium workbook is currently
normalized. See [`docs/historical-trade-data-model.md`](docs/historical-trade-data-model.md).

## Rebuild the Historical Atlas

The atlas builder derives relationships, instruments, events, stockpile-policy
markers, and NARA discovery overlays from the normalized History Stack IDs. It
does not infer production, supplier shares, route volume, alliance membership,
facility coordinates, or strategic risk.

```bash
python scripts/build_atlas_data.py
python scripts/validate_history_data.py
```

The builder also downloads and trims the public-domain Natural Earth 1:110m
country polygons used for modern spatial orientation. Use `--skip-basemap` when
only regenerating documentary overlays. Historical names and status come from
dated project records; these polygons are not historical boundary evidence.

The site vendors MapLibre GL JS 5.24.0 so GitHub Pages does not depend on a
runtime map CDN. Its BSD license is retained at
`assets/vendor/maplibre-gl/LICENSE.txt`.

## Configure NARA Safely

Create an ignored local file from the empty example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Set `NARA_API_KEY` in `.env.local` or export it in the environment. Never place
the key in `records-stage.html`, `assets/runtime-config.js`, browser JavaScript,
screenshots, logs, documentation, or a committed file.

Local proxy:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
python local_server.py --no-browser-open
```

When the site itself is served from `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`, the browser
automatically uses `http://localhost:5757` for NARA requests.

GitHub Pages cannot hold a server-side secret. Deploy `nara_proxy_worker.js` as a
serverless Worker, store the key as a secret named `NARA_API_KEY`, and put only
the public Worker URL in `assets/runtime-config.js`:

```js
window.HISTORY_RUNTIME_CONFIG = Object.freeze({
  naraProxyUrl: "https://your-worker.example"
});
```

NARA’s current API terms say not to cache or store returned API content, so v2
uses on-demand, `no-store` responses instead of a GitHub Actions cache. Static
query plans and authoritative Catalog links remain available if the API fails.
See [`docs/nara-integration.md`](docs/nara-integration.md).

## Add or Correct Historical Data

1. Add the official source to `data/history-stack/sources.json` through
   `scripts/build_history_pilot.py`.
2. Add or update the normalized entity and link existing IDs rather than copying
   descriptions into multiple files.
3. Preserve historical names, dates, units, official URLs, and completeness.
4. Leave unavailable fields empty and add a precise `data_gaps` note.
5. Rebuild statistics only from official machine-readable files or reviewed
   page-level transcriptions.
6. Run validation and tests before publication.

Core schemas are under `schemas/`. Crosswalks for aliases, HS codes, agencies,
countries, and supply-chain terms remain under `data/crosswalks/`. HS-code
mappings must retain confidence and caveats because product codes may not
identify mined origin.

## Rebuild the FRUS Subject Index

The index combines the subject mappings in
[`therealjameswilson/frus-subjects`](https://github.com/therealjameswilson/frus-subjects)
with official lightweight TOC files from
[`HistoryAtState/frus`](https://github.com/HistoryAtState/frus). It contains no
document body text.

```bash
python build_frus_subject_index.py \
  --subjects-root ../frus-subjects \
  --toc-root ../frus/frus-toc
```

See [`docs/frus-subject-index.md`](docs/frus-subject-index.md).

## Tests

```bash
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v
python scripts/validate_history_data.py
```

Validation checks entity minimums, unique IDs, cross-file references, the
1861–1992 boundary, year-by-year trade coverage, statistical provenance, atlas
layer semantics, `.env.example`, and tracked-file secret patterns.

## Provenance

This repository is a standalone v2 adaptation of
[`therealjameswilson/toolkit-template`](https://github.com/therealjameswilson/toolkit-template),
which descends from the FRUS On This Day toolkit. The v1 repository remains
preserved at
